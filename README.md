# Pomodoro Timer 🍅

A simple pomodoro website I made to while procastinating studying hehe 😅

I used this [Codedéx tutorial](https://www.codedex.io/projects/build-a-pomodoro-app-with-html-css-js) and then added some improvements and a Spotify embed.

I used Chat GPT to generate the background of the site. It's a girl programming along side a red panda (my favorite animal).

Overall it was a fun and easy coding project! Check it out [here](https://joanapeixinho.github.io/pomodoro-timer/) 🖤
